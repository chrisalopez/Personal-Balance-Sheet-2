# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# This will multiply the comment 50x's and will be inputted in the database.
# 50.times do |i|
#   Comment.create(comments: "Hello bob", user_id: 1)
# end
# 10.times do
#   Comment.create(comments: "Hello BOB", user_id: 1)
# end
